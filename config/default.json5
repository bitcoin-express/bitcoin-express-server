/*
  This file contains all allowed config keys to be used within the application.
  Application is using node config module (https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config) to handle config files.

  By default application will read config/default.js file and use configuration keys stored in it.

  In order to provide a mechanism to support environment's specific configuration the application will look for files
  extending the main configuration file where name of this file is stored in an environment variable: NODE_ENV

  In order to store sensitive information the application will look for a file called local.json5 and use configuration
  stored in it. This file may include credentials, database name and host etc.

  An example - assuming that NODE_ENV is set to "production" load order will be as follows:
  default.json5
  production.json5
  local.json5

  !!!   Please bear in mind that local.json5 should never be added into repository
  !!!   and is excluded on main .gitignore level.

  Files lower in the overriding chain should only include elements that need be overwritten.

  All keys set as undefined are required to be set in environment specific' files.
  app.js before server initialisation will check if all essential keys are set and throw an error if configuration is
  not full.
